# Project-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-On-Superstore-Dataset
## IBM Edunet Data Analysis Internship Project
### Project overview:
The Analysis of Sample Superstore Dataset project aims to leverage data analytics techniques to gain insights into the sales data of Sample Superstore, a retail company. The project involves analyzing a provided dataset containing information about customers, products, and transactions over a specific period.

The primary objectives of the project are as follows:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning:
Explore the dataset to understand its structure and variables.
Identify and handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
Prepare the dataset for further analysis.

2. Descriptive Analytics:
Perform basic statistical analysis to summarize and describe the dataset.
Generate descriptive statistics, such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation, for relevant variables.
Visualize data using charts, graphs, and histograms to gain initial insights.

3. Customer Segmentation:
Conduct customer segmentation based on various customer attributes, such as demographics and purchase behavior.
Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means clustering) to identify distinct customer segments.
Analyze the characteristics and preferences of each segment.

4. Sales Analysis:
Analyze sales trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly) to identify patterns and seasonality.
Examine the performance of different product categories and sub-categories.
Investigate the correlation between sales and other factors, such as region and customer segment.

5. Profitability Analysis:
Calculate profit margins for different products and product categories.
Identify the most profitable and least profitable products.
Analyze the impact of discounts, shipping costs, and other factors on profitability.

6. Customer Behavior Analysis:
Examine customer purchasing patterns, including frequency, recency, and monetary value.
Analyze customer loyalty and retention rates.
Investigate factors influencing customer churn and identify potential strategies for customer retention.

7. Recommendations and Insights:
Summarize the key findings and insights from the analysis.
Provide actionable recommendations to improve sales, profitability, and customer satisfaction.
Present the results in a clear and concise manner using visualizations and data-driven insights.

### EDA:
The EDA is done by using 3 analysis Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis. For the datavisualization following charts are used:

### Overall Conclusion
- Main reason which leads to loss is Discount.
- Some areas leads lo loss due to more discounts and some areas leads to less sales due to less discounts. It needs to be improved.
- It is better to give more discounts during festival seasons. So that more sales are made.
- Home office segment needs better improvement.
- Some cities have very less sales. It may be due to lack of awareness. So advertising in those cities will leads to sales.
